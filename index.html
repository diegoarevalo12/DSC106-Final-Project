            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Do hotter mice move more?</b> Temperature fluctuations in mammals often correlate with changes in energy expenditure 
                and activity patterns, but how this relationship plays out in a tightly controlled environment, such as that of laboratory mice,
                fuels the motivation for the project. This interactive dashboard <b>explores relationship between body temperature and physical activity 
                in mice</b>, specicifally examining how changes in core body temperature influence minute-level activity patterns over a 14-day period.
                By analyzing both male and female mice under a consistent 12-hour light/dark cycle, the project highlights differences in activity 
                across light phases and investigates the impact of estrus in females, where increased temperature and activity may reveal unique 
                behavioral patterns.

            <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset used in this project contains minute-level data on activity and core body temperature for both male and female mice 
                over a 14-day period. The lighting follows a 12-hour on, 12-hour off controlled square wave, aligning daily rhythms with a 
                consistent light-dark cycle. Mice, being nocturnal, exhibit peak activity during the dark phase. Notably, female mice experience 
                estrus every 4 days, a period linked to ovulation and characterized by longer, hotter, and more active intervals. 
                The data records the activity and body temperature of individual mice (unique IDs) for each minute.

                        This visualization depicts how <span class="red-bold">temperature</span> and <span class="blue-bold">activity</span> 
                        changes over time across different <b>settings that you can change above &uarr;</b>. What do you notice?

                        <br>
                        Notice the cyclical patterns and how temperature and activity often <b>peak and decline together</b>; both variables display
                        similar trends across different combinations of gender, time period and mouse ID. Regardless of these factors, 
                        the graph reveals a consistent pattern: activity and temperature <b>peak during the first 12 hours</b> (the dark phase, 
                        when mice are naturally more active) and gradually <b>decline during the following 12 hours</b> (the light phase, associated
                        with rest and lower activity). 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This cyclical pattern reveals that <b>core body temperature and physical activity are tightly
                        synchronized with the light-dark cycle</b>, with both metrics rising and falling in tandem over each 24-hour period.

                        This scatterplot depicts individual activity recordings on a case-by-case basis, highlighting the correlation between

                        <br>
                        In general, temperature (x-axis) is <b>positively correlated</b> with activity level (y-axis) for both male and female mice. 
                        However, the quantified correlation is only moderately strong, with the Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from <b>0.3 to 0.79</b>, 
                        depending on the characteristics being analyzed (e.g., individual mice vs. averages, male vs. female).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Why isn‚Äôt the correlation stronger?</b> A closer look reveals a higher density of points along the x-axis at an activity level of 0, 
                        indicating periods when the mice are likely sleeping. This pattern is further supported by the timestamps visible in the tooltips 
                        of the 24-hour scatterplot, aligning with the resting phase. Interestingly, the variance in temperature during these inactive periods
                        tends to be higher compared to when the mice are active, which contributes to the moderate correlation observed.
